# Discription
When presented with the ecommerce backend the app will post routes to the database. When using insomnia we are able to GET the info from the backend.
CREATE a new object for the database.
POST an update for any of the objects in the database.
And lastly DELETE an object from the database.

Todo all of this I have updated the routes to be able to traverse in insominia and recieve data and updated each model to store the appropriate data.
